### Oklahoma State University IEEE Student Chapter Vice President
The title is a mouthful but I was elected the new the Vice President of the student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers today! I've been helping the board for the past year and now have an official position. I'm super excited at all of the opportunities I'll have to farther expand this organization as well as to learn from all of our industry contacts and my peers.
