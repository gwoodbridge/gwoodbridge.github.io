### My First Major PCB Project
Today, I received my first project in Senior Design. For our first project, we have to simulate, layout, manufacture, assemble, and test a 3rd order bandpass filter. Luckily, the schematic and exact component values are given. However, they don't make components with the values or accuracy necessary. This will be a great project to learn:

1. How to simulate a circuit with components with tolerances.
2. How to layout a single layer Printed Circuit Board (PCB).
3. How a PCB is manufactured.
4. How accurate components are.
5. How to write a test procedure.
6. How to delegate work throughout a team.

Not only does this seem like a lot, but we also only have 3 weeks to work on it. So it'll also test our scheduling efficiency so we don't fall behind in other classes.
