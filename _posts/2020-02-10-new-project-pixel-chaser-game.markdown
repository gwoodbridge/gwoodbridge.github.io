### A Game For Engineering Expo
IEEE will be attending an engineering expo sponsored by the University in a few weeks and we were instructed to bring something interactive. This will be a great outreach for our club and for the engineering college. As Vice President of IEEE, I said I could make an arcade like game since I already had the material from previous projects. This meeting was last Friday (February 7); today, I finished the project. That is a 48-hour project from conception through building and coding to completion. It's a very basic game using a single button, 50 RGB LEDs, and an Arduino. I'll get the project added to my project page later this week with more details.
