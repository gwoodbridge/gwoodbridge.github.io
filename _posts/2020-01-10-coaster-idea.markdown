### The Idea
This idea is inspired by Matt Schmotzer and Print My Ride. He has 3D printed a few roller coasters so far. However, he focuses more on the mechanical aspect. I want to focus on the electrical side and use it as a test bed for various control systems and sensors. My goal is to create a miniature working kids roller coaster that is mostly 3D printed. My hope is to make it large enough to easily use various sensors without making it to large to transport or store. This is a decently complex project with a lot of modeling before I get anywhere close to messing with the electronics.
