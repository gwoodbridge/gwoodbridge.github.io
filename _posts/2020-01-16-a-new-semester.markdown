### A New Semester Begins
School has officially started back up again. I am super excited about all of my classes this semester. I'll be taking:
1. Automatic Control Systems
2. Random Signals and Noise
3. Communication Electronics
4. Senior Design 1

After this semester, I'll only have 4 classes left in my degree! It's crazy how fast time has flown by. I am probably most excited about Automatic Control Systems. It applies most to what I want to do in my career. Luckily, I've covered a lot of the material previously, so the course should be relatively easy. I just finished installing all of the software we will be using in Senior Design. We get to use Multisim and Eagle this year. Multisim is a circuit simulation software while Eagle is a PCB layout software. We also get to use the new laser PCB etcher in the Endeavor this year to make some custom PCBs! Multisim looks like it will be much easier to use than PSPice which I've used in previous semesters. Overall, excited for all of the new material I'll get to learn this semester and all of the project I'll complete along the way.
