Over the summer, I decided to brush up on my SolidWorks skills. At my parents' house, there is a large porch with an outdoor table and my dad's grill. Since we have a pool, we occasionally have guests over during the summer. I thought a pergola would be a great addition to the backyard and could offer some shade for our dogs when they are outside. We could even put some outdoor fans, lights, or possibly expanding with an outdoor kitchen. Just a pergola was a good place to start though.

### The Old
The first step to modeling the pergola is actually modeling what was already there. That meant modeling the A/C unit and the porch.

After that, I started modeling the north wall of the house and the gravel at the south end of the patio.

Next, I could begin modeling the east wall.

Finally, I could finish the model of existing items with the downspout at the corner of the east wall.

### The New
After modeling everything that was already in the backyard, I could begin modeling the start of the pergola. I started with 6, 9 foot high 6x6 beams.

Next, I could start on the support beams. These are 16 foot long 2x8's. Save yourself some time and only model 1 half, then you can mirror and linear pattern the rest.

After the support beams, I could begin placing the slats. These slats are 14 foot long 2x6's that are spaced at 12" centers. Once again, use linear pattern to save time.

Finally, I added some support 2x2's going the opposite direction of the slats to support the top of them.
