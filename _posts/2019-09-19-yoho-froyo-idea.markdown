###  The Idea
This idea is completely random but I enjoyed the rhyme and think the idea could fit in at Adventureland at Walt Disney World or at Disneyland. During my free time, I hope to sketch some potential menu items that are all pirate or ocean themed. If I get adventurous (lol), I may even sketch a potential building concept. I'm not as confident in my drawing abilities so we'll see how this project goes.
